# Python Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository! In this repository, I will be uploading my simple and beginner projects while I am learning Python. I will include even the smallest projects to track my progress effectively.

## Purpose
This repository serves multiple purposes:
- To document my learning journey in Python.
- To practice using Git for version control.
- To showcase the projects corresponding to what I am currently learning.

## Projects
- **Simple Calculator** (If Statements)
- **Moving Zeros to the End** ‚Äì This program takes a list of numbers and moves all zeros to the end of the list without changing the order of non-zero elements.
- **Validate Username** - This program checks the validity of a username based on specific requirements.
- **Menu Ordering System** ‚Äì A Python program that displays a menu, allows users to select items, and calculates the total price. Users can add items until typing "exit" and then receive a summary of their order and the total cost.
- **Banking Account Program** ‚Äì A simple banking system where users can view their balance, deposit funds, and withdraw funds. The program ensures that users cannot withdraw more than their current balance and displays the balance after each transaction.
- **Slot Machine Game** ‚Äì A beginner-friendly slot machine simulation where users can place bets, spin the reels, and try their luck. The game features symbols like üçÄ (Lucky Clover), üîî (Bell), üçâ (Watermelon), ‚≠ê (Star), and üçá (Grapes), each with different payout multipliers. Users start with a balance, place bets, and win based on matching symbols in a row. This project helped reinforce concepts of randomness, conditional logic, and basic game mechanics in Python.
- **[Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/KaLYes1337/RPS)** ‚Äì This project is a simple implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer. The program uses random selection for the computer's choice and conditional statements to determine the winner.
- **[Quiz Game](https://github.com/KaLYes1337/Quizgame)** ‚Äì This project is a multiple-choice quiz game that tests the user‚Äôs knowledge on various topics. The game presents questions, takes the user's answers, and provides feedback on their score at the end. This project helps in understanding how to work with lists, loops, and conditional logic in Python.


Stay tuned for more projects as I continue to learn!
